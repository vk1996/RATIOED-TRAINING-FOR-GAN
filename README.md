# FANTASTIC GANS AND HOW YOU TO TRAIN THEM ?????


YOU JUST FOUND MY WAY OF TRAINING A GAN FOR 64X64 FACES.

FOR ANY STABLE GENERATOR WE NEED A ROBUST DISCRIMINATOR, THIS WHERE WE UTILISE THE CONCEPT OF RATIOED LEARNING IN WHICH WE UPDATE THE WEIGHTS OF ADVERSARIAL NETWORK FOR EVERY ADVERSARIAL_RATIO TIMES THE WEIGHT UPDATED FOR DISCRIMINATOR NETWORK.

IN THIS CASE THE D_LOSS UPDATES TWICE BEFORE ONE D_LOSS IS UPDATED.BY THIS WAY WE REDUCE THE CHANCE OF GENERATOR FOOLING THE MORE-TRAINED DISCRIMINATOR WITH CRAP.FEEL FREE TO TUNE THIS RATIO WITHOUT COLLAPSING THE GAN.

I HAVE ATTACHED THE TRAINED MODEL OF GENERATOR AT 39000 EPOCHS.[generator_39500.h5]

CAUTION: I'M STILL A NOVICE WITH GANS AND THIS IS MY FIRST PROPER GIT IF FOUND ANY ISSUES KINDLY UPDATE ME.THANK YOU.
